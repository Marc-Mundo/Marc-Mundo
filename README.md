## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Marc. I am an MSc graduate in Neurobiology from Radboud University Nijmegen, currently looking for a job in Tech.

Here are some things I have worked on during my studies:

### Contextual Social Fear Learning (MSc Internship)
[Neurophysics Internship](https://github.com/Marc-Mundo/Neurophysics_internship) is a data science project that investigated the neural correlates of mice in a contextual social fear learning experiment. This included analysis of 2-photon fluorescence microscopy and behavioral data to quantify the amount of spatial information transferred in a virtual reality environment.

### Epileptic Neural Networks (MSc Internship)
[Synaptica Internship](https://github.com/Marc-Mundo/Epileptic_Networks) is another data science project that involved the development of a computational model of CA3 in the hippocampus. Network spiking simulations were generated and analyzed in a range of experiments to investigate genetic factors on network stability and causation for epileptic brain states.

I also have a selection of academic work written by me on GitHub, including a research proposal, systematic review, and my second thesis:

### Research Proposal on Visual Cortical Prosthetics
[VCP Research Proposal](https://github.com/Marc-Mundo/LaTeX-Research-Proposal)

### Systematic Review on Visual Cortical Prosthetics and AI
[Review](https://github.com/Marc-Mundo/LaTeX-Review)

### Thesis on Epileptic Neural Dynamics of CA3
[Thesis](https://github.com/Marc-Mundo/Synaptica_Thesis)
